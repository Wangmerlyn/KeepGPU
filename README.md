**Keep GPU** keeps shared GPUs from being reclaimed while you prep data, debug, or coordinate multi-stage pipelines. It allocates just enough VRAM and issues lightweight CUDA work so schedulers observe an “active” device—without running a full training job.

## Why it exists

On many clusters, idle GPUs are reaped or silently shared after a short grace period. The cost of losing your reservation (or discovering another job has taken your card) can dwarf the cost of a tiny keep-alive loop. KeepGPU is a minimal, auditable guardrail:

- **Predictable** – Single-purpose controller with explicit resource knobs (VRAM size, interval, utilization backoff).
- **Polite** – Uses NVML to read utilization and backs off when the GPU is busy.
- **Portable** – Typer/Rich CLI for humans; Python API for orchestrators and notebooks.
- **Observable** – Structured logging and optional file logs for auditing what kept the GPU alive.
- **Power-aware** – Uses intervalled elementwise ops instead of heavy matmul floods to present “busy” utilization while keeping power and thermals lower (see `CudaGPUController._run_mat_batch` for the loop).
- **NVML-backed** – GPU telemetry comes from `nvidia-ml-py` (the `pynvml` module), with optional `rocm-smi` support when you install the `rocm` extra.

## Quick start (CLI)

```bash
pip install keep-gpu

# Hold GPU 0 with 1 GiB VRAM and throttle if utilization exceeds 25%
keep-gpu --gpu-ids 0 --vram 1GiB --busy-threshold 25 --interval 60
```

### Platform installs at a glance

- **CUDA (example: cu121)**
  ```bash
  pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 torch
  pip install keep-gpu
  ```
- **ROCm (example: rocm6.1)**
  ```bash
  pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.1 torch
  pip install keep-gpu[rocm]
  ```
- **CPU-only**
  ```bash
  pip install torch
  pip install keep-gpu
  ```

Flags that matter:

- `--vram` (`1GiB`, `750MB`, or bytes): how much memory to pin.
- `--interval` (seconds): sleep between keep-alive bursts.
- `--busy-threshold`: skip work when NVML reports higher utilization.
- `--gpu-ids`: target a subset; otherwise all visible GPUs are guarded.

## Embed in Python

```python
from keep_gpu.single_gpu_controller.cuda_gpu_controller import CudaGPUController

with CudaGPUController(rank=0, interval=0.5, vram_to_keep="1GiB", busy_threshold=20):
    preprocess_dataset()   # GPU is marked busy while you run CPU-heavy code

train_model()              # GPU freed after exiting the context
```

Need multiple devices?

```python
from keep_gpu.global_gpu_controller.global_gpu_controller import GlobalGPUController

with GlobalGPUController(gpu_ids=[0, 1], vram_to_keep="750MB", interval=90, busy_threshold=30):
    run_pipeline_stage()
```

## What you get

- Battle-tested keep-alive loop built on PyTorch.
- NVML-based utilization monitoring (by way of `nvidia-ml-py`) to avoid hogging busy GPUs; optional ROCm SMI support by way of `pip install keep-gpu[rocm]`.
- CLI + API parity: same controllers power both code paths.
- Continuous docs + CI: mkdocs + mkdocstrings build in CI to keep guidance up to date.

## For developers

- Install dev extras: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (add `.[rocm]` if you need ROCm SMI).
- Fast CUDA checks: `pytest tests/cuda_controller tests/global_controller tests/utilities/test_platform_manager.py tests/test_cli_thresholds.py`
- ROCm-only tests carry `@pytest.mark.rocm`; run with `pytest --run-rocm tests/rocm_controller`.
- Markers: `rocm` (needs ROCm stack) and `large_memory` (opt-in locally).

### MCP endpoint (experimental)

- Start a simple JSON-RPC server on stdin/stdout (default):
  ```bash
  keep-gpu-mcp-server
  ```
- Or expose it over HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0 by way of POST):
  ```bash
  keep-gpu-mcp-server --mode http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
  ```
- Example request (one per line):
  ```json
  {"id": 1, "method": "start_keep", "params": {"gpu_ids": [0], "vram": "512MB", "interval": 60, "busy_threshold": 20}}
  ```
- Methods: `start_keep`, `stop_keep` (optional `job_id`, default stops all), `status` (optional `job_id`), `list_gpus` (basic info).
- Minimal client config (stdio MCP):
  ```yaml
  servers:
    keepgpu:
      command: ["keep-gpu-mcp-server"]
      adapter: stdio
  ```
- Minimal client config (HTTP MCP):
  ```yaml
  servers:
    keepgpu:
      url: http://127.0.0.1:8765/
      adapter: http
  ```
- Remote/SSH tunnel example (HTTP):
  ```bash
  keep-gpu-mcp-server --mode http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
  ```
  Client config (replace hostname/tunnel as needed):
  ```yaml
  servers:
    keepgpu:
      url: http://gpu-box.example.com:8765/
      adapter: http
  ```
  For untrusted networks, put the server behind your own auth/reverse-proxy or
  tunnel by way of SSH (for example, `ssh -L 8765:localhost:8765 gpu-box`).
